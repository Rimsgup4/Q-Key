                parental consent. We designed our system to permit children to use Q-key without Quiz collecting
                personally identifiable information other than persistent identifiers that recognize the Q-key user as a
                repeat visitor. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) all registration information
                you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and, (c)
                your use of the Service does not violate any applicable law or regulation.<br><br></li>

                occur under the account. You must immediately notify Q-key of any unauthorized uses of your data, your
                account or any other breaches of security. Q-key will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
                including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. Q-key may from time to
                time set storage limits for your data, or take any other measures Q-key considers appropriate to manage
                the Service. Q-key may also from time to time change its policies on offering commercial content or
                displaying advertising, and it may do this without notice.<br><br></li>
