    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em;" class="row">
        <p>Respecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These
            are our guiding privacy principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
            <li>We don’t keep your personal information longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.</li>
            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our
                services, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don’t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.</li>
            <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search
                engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Q-key collects, uses, shares, stores and protects your personally
            identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this
            information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information,
            including the option to use services without providing personal information.</p><br />
        <p>We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes
            this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations:
            Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Protecting students and their personal information</h3><br />
        <p>Q-key believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections
            and we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and The General Data Protection
            Regulation (“GDPR”). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational
            Rights Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Q-key offers a limited feature set and web site experience for young users of
            Q-key. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to
            create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their
            own, Q-key does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to
            safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Q-key does not
            accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.</p><br />
        <p>Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Q-key:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Behaviorally targeted advertising is not permitted on Q-key.</li>
            <li>Students can join games without creating an account.</li>
            <li>Students who have not or cannot provide consent have a limited product experience.</li>
            <li>The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.</li>
            <li>Q-key are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.</li>
        </ul><br />
        <h3>Parental Rights</h3><br />
        <p>Q-key empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this
            means under 13) who have registered accounts with Q-key to exercise their legal rights pursuant to
            legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Q-key of a child's
            personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third
            parties by Q-key. Currently, the only personal information we collect from a child younger than 13 is their
            parent's or guardian’s email address.</p><br />
        <p>
            Parents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Q-Key by accessing
            their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child’s access to Q-key.
            Parents may also request that Q-key delete that information and refuse to allow Q-key to collect further
            information from their children . Q-key may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the
            identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information,
            or a request to refuse further collection from children.</p><br />
        <p>Q-key will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Q-key.
            While Q-key will assign persistent identifiers to all Q-key users to recognize repeat visitors and improve
            their Quiz experience.</p><br />
        <p>
            As you use the service, you may also create academic content including quizzes and certain forms of
            responses. This information is not typically personally identifying, but it may be deleted at any time
            either by the relevant account holder or by reaching out to our team .</p><br />
        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3><br />
        <p>We receive and store some types of information automatically as you use the service. These may include device
            information such as device model, operating system, and device identifiers such as IDFA and UDID. </p><br />
        <p>Quizizz also collects log information as you use the service. These data may include information regarding
            how and when you use the service as well as your browser type, preferred language, time zone, referring
            site, and internet protocol (IP) address. </p><br />
        <p>We may use your IP address to generate a general approximation of your location to provide the service.
            Examples include providing the right version of Quiz based on your state or country and helping teachers
            select their school when they sign up.
